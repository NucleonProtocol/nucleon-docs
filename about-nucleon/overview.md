# Overview

Nucleon is a liquid staking solution for Conflux PoS backed by industry-leading staking providers. Nucleon lets users stake their CFX- without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure.

Our goal is to solve the problems associated with Conflux PoS staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked CFX liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of CFX to improve security of the Conflux network.

### How does Nucleon work ?

When staking with Nucleon, users receive xCFX tokens on a 1:1 basis representing their staked CFX. xCFX balances can be used like regular CFX to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your CFX staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups when staking with Nucleon, and have minimum deposits of 1 CFX to decrease DDoS risks.

When using Nucleon, staking rewards will be compound  in real-time, allowing for participation in the securing of Conflux without the associated risks and downside potential.

### What Makes Nucleon Unique?

Nucleonis the very first liquid staking solution to launch on Conflux eSpace, an EVM-compatible smart contract execution environment build on top of Conflux that allows developers to deploy and execute Ethereum-native dApps and smart contracts within the Conflux ecosystem. NUCLEON aims to build the most robust liquid staking ecosystem on Conflux, with plans to give users more opportunities to participate Conflux POS staking without decrease users token liquidity.

### How Is the NucleonNetwork Secured? <a href="#how-is-the-nucleon-network-secured" id="how-is-the-nucleon-network-secured"></a>

Nucleon is Open-sourcing & continuous review of all code and audit by Hacken . Nucleon can be supported by the wallets on Conflux eSpace. These include MetaMask, WalletConnect, TokenPocketï¼ŒLedger and Fluent Wallet.

### Who Are the Founders of Nucleon? <a href="#who-are-the-founders-of-nucleon" id="who-are-the-founders-of-nucleon"></a>

Nucleon is a liquid staking solution for Conflux PoS backed by industry-leading staking providers that was launched by a team X-Dao(XD) which is a international Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

XD is  a group of Web3 pioneers including top engineers and scientists to develop the most practical and efficient decentralized applications. For the future of mankind, we build infrastructure based on the fastest blockchain at present -- the conflux network. The first battle is Nucleon, the first liquid staking solution to solve the problems associated with Conflux PoS staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility.

In the future, XD will build more excellent applications to help the POW network move towards a brighter decentralized world.
