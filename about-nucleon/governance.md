# Governance

Governance is run by a community of stakeholders incentivized to participate in the organization’s operations by a shared goal, and use NUT as governance token by an additional cryptoeconomic mechanism. The rules of Governance  are inscribed by X-Dao(XD) into smart contracts that lay out the foundational framework of how the DAO functions.
