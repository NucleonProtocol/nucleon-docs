# From Exchanges

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Note** **to Binance users and bCFX holders**: Conflux on Binance is listed as wrapped ERC-20 token, it is not native CFX. Conflux eSpace and BNB Chain use EVM-compatible addresses, but those addresses live in different chains.
{% endhint %}

* **Note**: Currently, only KuCoin and Gate.io support native CFX transfers to Conflux eSpace.

To learn how to transfer native eSpace CFX from different exchanges, see:

* Gate.io: Transferring eSpace CFX from Gate.io to MetaMask
