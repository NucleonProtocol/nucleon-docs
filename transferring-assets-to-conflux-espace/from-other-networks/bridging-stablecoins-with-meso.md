# Bridging Stablecoins with Meso

[Meson](http://meson.fi) is a stablecoin cross-chain swap protocol that supports multiple networks. With Meson, you can bridge either USDC or USDT tokens from different networks into Conflux eSpace, or from Conflux eSpace to other networks.

  * Ethereum (USDC/USDT)
  * BNB Chain (USDC/USDT)
  * Tron (USDT)
  * Avalanche (USDC)
  * Fantom (USDC)
  * Polygon (USDC)
