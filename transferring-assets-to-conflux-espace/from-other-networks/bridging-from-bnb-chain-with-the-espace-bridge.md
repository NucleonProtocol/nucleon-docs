# Bridging from BNB Chain with the eSpace Bridge

The eSpace Bridge is a cross-space and cross-chain bridge, that allows you to transfer CFX and other tokens between across spaces (Core Space and eSpace) and across chains (eSpace and BNB Chain).

In this guide, we'll bridge CFX from **BNB Chain** to **Conflux eSpace** through the eSpace Bridge.

## Prerequisites

* Your MetaMask wallet connected to Conflux eSpace and BNB Chain.
* A BNB Chain account funded with bCFX and BNB.
* A Conflux eSpace account funded with CFX to pay for transaction fees.
