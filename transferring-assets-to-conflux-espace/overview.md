# Overview

To start using Nucleon, you'll need to fund your wallet on Conflux eSpace with different assets. Transferring assets to Conflux eSpace is super simple and there are different ways to do this.

In short, to transfer assets to your Conflux eSpace account you can:&#x20;

1. Transfer them natively from an exchange, such as KuCoin and Gate.io.&#x20;
2. Bridge them from Conflux Core Space.&#x20;
3. Bridge them from other networks, such as Ethereum and BNB chain.&#x20;

The following image shows an overview of these options:&#x20;
