# From Other Networks

In this section, you'll learn how to transfer your assets from other networks, such as Ethereum and BNB Chain, to Conflux eSpace using different cross-chain bridges.

* You can use the [Multichain](broken-reference), [cBridge](broken-reference), and [Meson](broken-reference) cross-chain bridges to transfer your assets from other networks to Conflux eSpace.
* For a quick reference table to bridges to Conflux eSpace, see [Bridges to Conflux eSpace](../quick-reference/bridges-to-conflux-espace.md).
* Once you bridge your assets to Conflux eSpace, you'll need to add the token contract addresses to MetaMask. See [Token Contract Addresses](../quick-reference/token-contract-addresses.md) to see the contract addresses for different tokens, such as USDT, cETH, and cBTC.
