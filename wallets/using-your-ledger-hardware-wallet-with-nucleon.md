# Using Your Ledger Hardware Wallet with Nucleon

{% hint style="danger" %}
Support for Conflux eSpace in Ledger devices is currently under review.
{% endhint %}

You can also use your [Ledger](https://ledger.com/) hardware wallet to trade on Nucleon, even before the official Conflux eSpace app on Ledger is released. To accomplish this, we'll need to enable blind signing in the Ethereum app of your Ledger device.

## Prerequisites

* Connect your Ledger wallet to MetaMask or Wallet Connect. See [_Using Ledger with MetaMask on Conflux eSpace_](https://developer.confluxnetwork.org/guides/en/using\_ledger\_on\_espace/) __ to learn how_._ For the purposes of this guide, we'll use MetaMask.
* Enable Blind "smart contract data" or "blind signing" on your Ledger device. To learn more about bling signing, refer to [this article](https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-signing-explained) on Ledger's Academy portal.

## Enabling Blind Signing on your Ledger Device

1. Go to the **Ethereum** app in your Ledger device.
2.  In the Ethereum app, go to **Settings**.
